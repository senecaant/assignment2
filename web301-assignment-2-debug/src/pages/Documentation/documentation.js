          <ul>
            <li>Make sure all Components are capitalized.</li>
            <li>If a file is importing a file, make sure the file exists and the component has been exported!</li>
            <li>Sometimes there are errors, but React won't pick them up because they are behavioural errors. Do all your links work?</li>
